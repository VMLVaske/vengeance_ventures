The name "Vengeance Ventures" reflects our founders personal journey: as the firstborn daughter in a family business that favored patriarchal traditions, she set out to build her own path.

Founded in 2022, today Vengeance Ventures is driven by a mission to empower businesses and individuals who are making a positive impact in the world.

We believe in fair business practices, collaborative relationships, and using technology as a force for good.

While our roots are in blockchain technology (Ethereum ecosystem) and innovative projects like NFT lending and privacy-focused solutions, we’re equally passionate about helping local businesses thrive.

Whether you’re a small business looking to establish an online presence or a startup with a bold idea, we’re here to bring your vision to life.

We’re not just building websites - **we’re building partnerships.**
